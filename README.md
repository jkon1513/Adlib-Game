# Adlib-Game
A fun Adlib game that allows users to create funny entertaining stories

The Way this game will work is it will prompt users for a type of word (noun, adjective, verb, name, object.....etc). 
It will then populate a premade story template with the choices they make. version 1 will use hardcoded template to get functionality correct, then version 2 will shift to reading templates in from text files to allow for greater flexibility and easier expansion of story base.
